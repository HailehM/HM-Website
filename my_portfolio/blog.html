Now I'm Falling Asleep
<br>
And She's Calling A Cab
<br>
While He Is Having A Smoke
<br>
And She's Taking A Drag
<br>
Now They Are Going To Bed
<br>
And My Stomach Is Sick
<br>
And It's All In My Head
<br>
But She's Touching His<br>
Chest Now, He Takes Off Her
<br>
Dress Now, Let Me Go
<br>
And I Just Can't Look
<br>
It's Killing Me
<br>
They Are Taking Control
<br>
Jealousy!

Turning Saints Into The Sea

Swimming Through Sick Lullabies

Choking On Your Alibis

But It's Just The Price I Pay

Destiny Is Calling Me

Open Up My Eager Eyes

I do really like Mr. Brightside, it's a very good song with a very relatable mood and the instrumentals are rather soothing despite being mostly drums. Go check it out please, as well as Concertina Ballerina since the instrumental is also very epic. Have you ever heard of a Harpsichord? It's pretty much a pino with 2 sets of key rows, and sounds a lot different from the usual piano as well. That's actually what Mozart used, not a piano. You should go check it out if you haven't already. Harps are also really cool, I personally want to learn how to play one. May be too small though, but they sound so magical it's unreal!  </p>
